# multi_modal_sentiment_analysis_system

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a system that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset that includes both textual and image data. You will need to:

Preprocess both types of data.
Build models to analyze sentiment in text (using NLP techniques).
Analyze sentiment in images (using computer vision techniques).
Combine both models to produce a final sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
## Tasks
1. Dataset Preparation:

Use a publicly available multi-modal dataset, such as the Twitter Sentiment AnalysisLinks to an external site. with Images dataset, which includes both text and corresponding image data.
The dataset should include:
Text data: Tweets, captions, or any textual content.
Image data: Corresponding images, memes, or attached photos.
Sentiment labels: Each data entry should have a sentiment labelâ€”positive, negative, or neutral.
2. NLP Component (Text Analysis):

Preprocess the text data by applying standard techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lowercasing.
Extract features from the text using popular word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings.
Build a sentiment classification model for the text data using an NLP framework like Hugging Face, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow.
3. Computer Vision Component (Image Analysis):

Preprocess the image data by resizing and normalizing the images for model input.
Use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as ResNet or VGG to extract features from the images.
Build a sentiment classification model for the image data.
4. Fusion and Final Classification:

Combine the features from both the text and image models. You can use a concatenation layer or any other fusion technique to merge the feature vectors.
Train a final model (such as a fully connected layer) to perform sentiment classification based on the combined features from both the text and image models.
